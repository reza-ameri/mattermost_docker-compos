🧾 What is Mattermost?
Mattermost is an open-source, self-hosted collaboration platform built for team messaging, file sharing, and DevOps workflows. It’s a secure alternative to proprietary messaging platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord, offering full control over data, infrastructure, and integrations.

Designed for both small teams and large enterprises, Mattermost provides real-time chat with channels, direct messaging, notifications, and integrations with tools like GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Jenkins, and more. It supports high levels of customization, automation, and enterprise-grade features such as:

🔑 Key Highlights:
🛡️ Self-hosted & private – Run it on your own servers or in your cloud. Your data, your rules.

💬 Team Communication – Organized conversations via channels (public & private), threads, and DMs.

🔌 Powerful Integrations – Easily connects with DevOps tools for CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, alerts, etc.

🔐 Security-first – Role-based access control, audit logs, encryption, and compliance features.

🧱 Extensible – Create plugins, bots, and webhooks or customize with your own branding.

📱 Cross-platform clients – Access from web, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and mobile apps (iOS, Android).
